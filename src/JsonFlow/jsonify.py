    Filters the instance's structured data using the specified criteria.

    This method allows extraction of specific fields from structured data represented
    as nested dictionaries or lists contained within the class instance. The provided 
    criteria are used to filter the data and return only the corresponding fields.

    Args:
    - criteria (dict | list | bool | callable): The criteria to be used for filtering.
      - If a dictionary, the method will return a new dictionary with corresponding fields.
      - If a list, it will return a list of filtered data.
      - If True, it will return the original data without filtering.
      - If a callable, it will apply the function to the respective value in the dictionary.

    Returns:
    - dict | list | None: The filtered data as per the provided criteria or None if the criteria
      is neither a dictionary nor a list.

    Accesses nested values within the instance's data using a path of keys which can contain regular expressions.

    This method is designed to delve deep into nested structures, pulling out values that match a

    for flexible and pattern-based searching within the class instance's data.

    Args:
