# Enhancing Data with Cleaning, Processing, and Structuring in JSON

In the data preparation phase for building our system, a robust cleaning and processing approach will be implemented. This process aims to enhance the data's quality and utility, making it more readable and manageable by both software and humans.

## Data Cleaning and Processing:

Data cleaning involves identifying and correcting anomalies, missing values, or inconsistencies. Furthermore, the data will be processed to eliminate duplicates, outliers, and irrelevant information. This cleaning and processing procedure aims to establish a solid foundation of quality data.

## Strategic Use of JSON:

To effectively store and structure the data, we will adopt the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON is an ideal choice due to its ability to represent information hierarchically and legibly, coupled with its broad interoperability with various technologies, such as using APIs.

## Technical Specification for Hierarchical Structuring:

When using JSON, we will apply technical specifications to create a hierarchical structure of our data components. Each element will be organized into nested objects, reflecting their natural relationships and making navigation and analysis easier. Additionally, we will establish textual linearity, offering a clear understanding of the structure.

## Modulation and Hierarchy of the Knowledge Base:

Adopting JSON not only contributes to data clarity but also allows for the modulation of the knowledge base. Each component will be mapped to a defined JSON object, constructing a hierarchy representing the relationships between the elements. This will result in a cohesive and accessible representation of the underlying knowledge base.

By rigorously applying cleaning and processing procedures, combined with effective structuring in JSON, we are strengthening the foundation of our system. This approach will result in high-quality data, ready to fuel analyses, insights, and significantly contribute to the project's success.

### Example of Data Structure in JSON:

Documents within folders will be standardized to have a dictionary structure. This structure will include special folders for specific directory characteristics, such as the files in that folder, tags, vector ids, etc. It should be easily expandable in terms of attributes, with flexible content. Each dictionary's key would represent an attribute, and its item would be its respective static or dynamic value.

This methodology follows a contextualization strategy based on the premises of decomposition at the modular structure level. This consists of **features**, **items**, and **subitems** of the respective module contextualized by depth or hierarchy level.

+ **features**: These are the module's characteristics, which can be of a static or dynamic nature. For example: name, type, creation date, etc.
+ **items**: These represent the main components or elements of the module. They can be individual entities or groups of related data within the module. Examples might include individual files, specific categories, or primary data sets.
+ **subitems**: These are finer-grained elements or subdivisions of the items. They might represent specific sections within a file, subsections of categories, or subsets of data within the primary data sets.

Example of document structure in JSON:

- Folder structure example:

```markdown
- books
  - Mathematics
    - Probability
      - "introduction_to_probability.pdf"
      - "random_variable_exercises.txt"
    - Geometry
  - Physics
  - Chemistry
```

- **Enriched JSON Structure Example**:

```json
{  
  "books": {
    "files": [],
    "features": {"type": "folder"},
    "Mathematics": {
      "files": [],
      "features": {"type": "folder"},
      "Probability": {
        "files": [
          {
            "introduction_to_probability.pdf": {
              "features": {
                "type": "file",
                "author": "<NAME>",
                "tags": "probability, mathematics, introduction, statistics",
                "publication_date": "2019-01-01",
              },
              "content": ["temp/introduction_to_probability.json"]
            }
          },
          {
            "random_variable_exercises.txt": {...}
          }
        ]
      },
      "Geometry": {...},
    },
    "Physics": {...},
    "Chemistry": {...}
  }
}
```

- **Example of Accessing the Data Content**:

```json
// When trying to access the hierarchy in this manner:
// books/Mathematics/Probability/introduction_to_probability.pdf
// the system will return the content of the file:
// temp/introduction_to_probability.json
// which is used by the business rule and given by the programmer

{
  "text": ["
    # Introduction to Random Variables\n ... ![image-1](Figure1: representation of a random variable.) ...
    ## Definition of Random Variable\n ... 
    ## Cumulative Distribution Function\n ...
    ## Probability Distribution Function\n ...
    "],
  "images": {
    "image-1": "temp/img/image.jpeg"
    },
    ...
}
```

**Program Content Retrieval Execution**:

```json
// returns the text content
books/Mathematics/Probability/introduction_to_probability.pdf/content/Introduction-to-Random-Variables/

// returns the content of a specific section
books/Mathematics/Probability/introduction_to_probability.pdf#Introduction-to-Random-Variables

books/Mathematics/Probability/introduction_to_probability.pdf#Introduction-to-Random-Variables?images=image-1
// returns the content of a specific section of a specific content
```
